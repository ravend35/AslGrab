Thank you for using AslGrab – a Chrome extension designed to assist dropshippers in gathering product information from Amazon efficiently.

1. Information Collection

AslGrab does not collect or store any personal information. The extension operates entirely within your browser and only interacts with Amazon product pages to extract public product data such as:

ASIN (Amazon Standard Identification Number)

Product Title

Price

Prime status

This data is processed locally in your browser and is not sent to any server.

2. Use of Data

All data collected by the extension is used solely to:

Display information to the user

Allow users to manage and copy product identifiers

Improve productivity for e-commerce sellers

No personal user information is gathered, stored, or transmitted.

3. Data Sharing

We do not share any user data with third parties. The extension does not connect to any external analytics or ad networks.

4. Data Storage

AslGrab does not store any information on external servers. Data is only temporarily stored in your browser’s memory or local storage, and is under your full control.

5. User Rights

Since we do not collect personal data, there is no need for deletion or export functionality. You may remove any locally stored extension data by uninstalling the extension or clearing your browser’s site data.

6. Policy Changes

Any changes to this Privacy Policy will be updated on our website and/or extension listing. Continued use of AslGrab after changes means you accept the revised policy.
